# Hands on ML projects

This repo contains projects based on "Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow.
Started on Jan 25th, the aim of this repo is to understand and practice production level ML algorithms.

The purpose was not to mindlessly copy the given code, but to be able to replicate it on my own.
Hence, the project is expected to take longer than what I have expected.

Thank you for checking out my repo :)
